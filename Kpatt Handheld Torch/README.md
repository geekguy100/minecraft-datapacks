## What is it?
Handeld Torch is a data pack that provides lighting around the player while they are holding a <em>regular</em> torch, whether it's in their primary or off hand.

## Requirements
Handheld torch requires the player to be holding a torch either in their primary or off hand.

## How to use
Simply hold a torch in your primary or off hand. That's it!

## How it works
The data pack looks for players holding a torch. If a player holding a torch is found, an invisible armor stand is summoned at their position. That armor stand then spawns a soul torch on the nearest block (including air). When the player moves away from that armor stand, the armor stand will destroy the soul torch, the item it drops, and ultimately itself.

## Important Notices ‚ùó
Given that this data pack relies on soul torches being placed, placing and destorying soul torches while holding a regular torch is unadvised as the soul torch may be destroyed.
